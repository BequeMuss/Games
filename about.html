    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>
        This website was created as a personal learning project to improve my skills in web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        It features a small browser-based game, entirely built from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is <strong>non-commercial</strong>, contains <strong>no advertising</strong>, and is not affiliated with any company or brand.
        It is intended purely for educational purposes and as a demonstration of my programming progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        All code and content were developed independently. The site does not include user accounts, tracking tools, or third-party services.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that this project can be accessed in educational environments, as it was built to encourage learning and creativity through coding.
    </p>
